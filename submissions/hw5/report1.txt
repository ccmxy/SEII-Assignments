Issue: Player and the dealer are not dealt 2 cards when the game begins.

Description:

The rules of blackjack clearly state that at the beginning of the game,
each player and the dealer are dealt two cards. Instead, the player is dealt one
card, and the dealer is dealt a card per player. 


Test snippet:

    @Test
    public void PlayerIsInitiallyDealtTwoCardsTest(){

      DealerAction dt = mock(DealerAction.class);
      PlayerAction pa = mock(PlayerAction.class);

      when(pa.getAction()).thenReturn(PlayerAction.ActionType.STAND);

      SimpleBlackjack j = new SimpleBlackjack(dt,new PlayerAction[]{pa});
      j.playRound();

      verify(dt, times(2)).dealCard(pa);
    }


This should pass because according to the rules of blackjack, each player is initially dealt 2 cards.
If a player is dealt 2 cards, then they must be dealt to that player by the dealer twice.
Instead, test results indicate that the dealer only dealt to the player once.

Test results with original code:

  org.mockito.exceptions.verification.TooLittleActualInvocations: dealerAction.dealCard( Mock for PlayerAction, hashCode: 503195940 );
  Wanted 2 times: -> at edu.osu.blackjack.SimpleBlackjackTest.PlayerIsInitiallyDealtTwoCardsTest(SimpleBlackjackTest.java:105)
  But was 1 time: -> at edu.osu.blackjack.SimpleBlackjack.playRound(SimpleBlackjack.java:29) at edu.osu.blackjack.SimpleBlackjackTest.PlayerIsInitiallyDealtTwoCardsTest(SimpleBlackjackTest.java:105)

Original code snippet:

    for(PlayerAction p: players ){
      dealer.dealCard(dealer);
      dealer.dealCard(p);
    }

We can immediately see 2 glaring things wrong with this code. One is that the
dealer is dealt one card per PLAYER, when the number of players
should have no impact on the number of cards the dealer is dealt. The other is
that the player is only dealt one card.

Code snippets added to SimpleBlackjack.java that removed the bug:

  dealer.dealCard(dealer);
  dealer.dealCard(dealer);


  for(PlayerAction p: players ){
    dealer.dealCard(p);
    dealer.dealCard(p);
  }
