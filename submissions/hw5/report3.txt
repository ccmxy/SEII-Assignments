Issue: compareAndSettle causes user's wallet to be set to null, rather than
causing them to gain or lose money depending on the outcome of the cards
and the bet that they have placed.

Description:

 How blackjack works (according to the variation that I have played it)
 is that if(1) the player wins, they win the amount of money they bet,
 if(2) the dealer wins, the dealer wins the player's bet money, and if
 (3) the player has insurance and the dealer's score is 21, the player wins
 double their bet.

 Test snippet:

     @Test
     public void dealerCompareAndSettlePlayerBustTest() {

       Dealer dealer = new Dealer();
       //Give the dealer a score of 19
       dealer.acceptCard(new Card(Card.Face.TEN, Card.Suit.HEART));
       dealer.acceptCard(new Card(Card.Face.NINE, Card.Suit.DIAMOND));


       Player player = new Player();

       //Give the player a score of 27.
       //Because their score is above 21, this is called a bust
       //and the player should lose their bet.

       player.acceptCard(new Card(Card.Face.NINE, Card.Suit.HEART));
       player.acceptCard(new Card(Card.Face.NINE, Card.Suit.DIAMOND));
       player.acceptCard(new Card(Card.Face.NINE, Card.Suit.DIAMOND));

       //Standard bet of 10 is placed
       player.makeBet();

       dealer.compareHandAndSettle(player);
       int currentWallet = player.currentWallet;

       //The player's wallet has gone from the default of
       // 1000 to 990
       assertEquals(currentWallet, 990);

      }

  Instead of being successful, this throws an error of NullPointer exception.

Let's look at the compareHandAndSettle function:

@Override
public void compareHandAndSettle(PlayerAction p) {
  int dealerScore = handScore(dealerHand);
  int currentBet = p.getCurrentBet();

  if(dealerScore<handScore(p.getHand())){
    p.acceptMoney(currentBet*2);
  }
  else if(isInsuranceAvailable() && dealerScore == 21){
    p.acceptMoney(currentBet*3);
  }

  deck.addAll(p.getHand());
  p.nextHand();

  deck.addAll(dealerHand);
  dealerHand.clear();
}

This error has 3 causes:

1) In compareHandAndSettle() (in Dealer.java) there is no option
for if the dealer has a higher handscore than the player.

2) Even if there was, the playerAction interface doesn't have any way to
 subtract money from the player's wallet.

And 3) As we can see, at the end p.nextHand() is called in this function.
Taking a look at nextHand(), in Player.java...

    @Override
    public void nextHand() {
      currentBet = null;
      currentWallet = null;
      currentInsurance = null;
    }

Setting the player's wallet to null after every round
really doesn't make any sense. That creates a situation where
the player will always end up broke. So, we will comment out the line
currentWallet = null.

Then we will add a new method to the Player class as well as the PlayerAction
interface for loseMoney().

Here it is in Player.java:

      @Override
      public void loseMoney(int i){
        currentWallet -= i;
      }

And finally we will edit the class compareHandAndSettle to account for
when the player loses. (I think maybe that the reason currentBet
is doubled and tripled when the player wins/has insurance is because this was
designed such that the player's money was to be taken from their wallet as soon
as they placed their bet, so I also adjusted those numbers).


    	@Override
    	public void compareHandAndSettle(PlayerAction p) {
    		int dealerScore = handScore(dealerHand);
    		int currentBet = p.getCurrentBet();

    		if(dealerScore<handScore(p.getHand())){
    			p.acceptMoney(currentBet);
    		}

        /**** NEW ****/
    		else if(dealerScore>handScore(p.getHand())){
    			p.loseMoney(currentBet);
    		}
    			else if(isInsuranceAvailable() && dealerScore == 21){
    			p.acceptMoney(currentBet*2);
    		}


    		deck.addAll(p.getHand());
    		p.nextHand();

    		deck.addAll(dealerHand);
    		dealerHand.clear();
    	}
