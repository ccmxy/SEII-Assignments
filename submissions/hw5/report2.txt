Issue: Player not recognized as having insurance.

Description:

In blackjack, "Insurance is a side bet that the dealer has blackjack and is
 treated independently of the main wager. It pays 2:1 (meaning that the player
 receives two dollars for every dollar bet) and is available when the dealer's
 exposed card is an ace. "

 However, a test showed even when the dealer does have a visible ace,
  Dealer.isInsuranceAvaliable() returns false.

Test snippet:

    @Test
    public void dealerIsInsuranceAvailableTrueTest() {
     Dealer dealer = new Dealer();
     //Create an ace
     Card card = new Card(Card.Face.ACE, Card.Suit.HEART);
     //Make it visible (face up)
     card.setVisible(true);
     //Give it to the dealer
     dealer.acceptCard(card);
     assertTrue(dealer.isInsuranceAvailable());
    }


Test results with original code:

failure type="java.lang.AssertionError">
java.lang.AssertionError at edu.osu.blackjack.ColleenTest.dealerIsInsuranceAvailableTrueTest(ColleenTest.java:97)
</failure>

This is because the isInsuranceAvailable() function looks at the cards in
dealerHand, which is never filled. A quick glance at "acceptCard()" shows that
it was actually adding to the deck instead of to the dealer's hand:

      @Override
      public void acceptCard(Card c) {
        deck.add(c);
      }

To counter this, we simply change the acceptCard override (in Dealer.java)
to this:

  @Override
  public void acceptCard(Card c) {
    dealerHand.add(c);
  }
